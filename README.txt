Summary
The Battle of the Bulge, fought from December 16, 1944, to January 16, 1945, was Nazi Germany's final major offensive on the Western Front during World War II. The Germans aimed to split the Allied forces and capture the vital port of Antwerp. Launching a surprise attack through the Ardennes Forest, they created a significant "bulge" in the Allied lines. Despite initial advances, the offensive was ultimately repelled by the Allies. The battle was the bloodiest for American forces in Western Europe, with approximately 20,000 U.S. soldiers killed and tens of thousands more wounded, missing, or captured. The German defeat depleted their resources, paving the way for the Allied invasion of Germany.
