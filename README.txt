Summary
The Battle of the Bulge, fought from December 16, 1944, to January 16, 1945, was Nazi Germany's final major offensive on the Western Front during World War II. The Germans aimed to split the Allied forces and capture the vital port of Antwerp. Launching a surprise attack through the Ardennes Forest, they created a significant "bulge" in the Allied lines. Despite initial advances, the offensive was ultimately repelled by the Allies. The battle was the bloodiest for American forces in Western Europe, with approximately 20,000 U.S. soldiers killed and tens of thousands more wounded, missing, or captured. The German defeat depleted their resources, paving the way for the Allied invasion of Germany.

By making this narrative, my goal was to tell the story of the Battle of the Bulge in a way that was both exciting and easy to follow. I chose to tell the events in order, starting with the surprise German attack, moving through the key moments of the battle, and ending with the Allied victory. This way, listeners could understand how the battle unfolded and feel the tension of each turning point. I focused on important details, like the siege of Bastogne and General Patton’s rescue, to show how close the battle was and how hard the soldiers fought.  

I wanted the narrative to be both educational and engaging. I used a serious but dramatic tone to help listeners feel the intensity of the battle while also learning about its historical importance. I also included quotes, like General McAuliffe’s famous “Nuts!” response, to bring the story to life and make it feel more real. The script was designed for an audio format, meaning I had to think about pacing, clarity, and how to make it sound natural when read aloud. Shorter sentences and clear transitions helped ensure the story flowed smoothly.  

As I researched and wrote this piece, I considered how historians and educators talk about the Battle of the Bulge. From my own experience, which was watching a lot of documentaries and videos and video games, I wanted to make the battle easier to understand for those who might not be familiar with it. Feedback from my teacher and classmates helped me improve my script by making certain parts clearer and more engaging. They suggested adding more details in some places and simplifying others to keep the pacing strong, while also helping me find good and reliable sources. 

Overall, this project helped me improve my storytelling skills while also learning more about an important event in history. Using Audacity to record and edit my script made me think about how words sound, not just how they read on paper. This experience taught me how to take feedback, adjust my work, and create a final project that I’m proud of.
